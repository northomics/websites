## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is a test page, exported by wp2static plugin in wordpress. 
It provides a new way for static website building using wordpress for non-programmers. 
A wordpress server (it could be wordpress official site, but function very limited unless pay the business plan, recommend installation on local computers, or amason cloud if you need better accessbility and stability) is needed for website buidling, once build up, you can export the website as a static website, hosted anywhere (github, gitlab etc.) and shutdown the wordpress server unless needed again to update your website.
